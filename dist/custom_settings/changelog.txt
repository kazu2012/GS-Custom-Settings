  Changed:
    - Removed the ability to view all tabs in one (performance)
    - Plugin folder ko_base deleted, contents moved into one folder
    - Renamed plugin more appropriately to 'Custom settings' as the focus and intent shifted away from original design.
    - Added readme.md to ZIP package with some basic instructions
    - Setting lookups 'tokens' must now be set manually
    - Removed content filters temporarily
    - Removed 'fancy' inputs temporarily
    - Settings in the plugin's PHP functions must now be retrieved with function($tab, $setting) instead of 'tab/setting'
    - Added or modified ko_site_settings functions:
        - get_setting($setting,$echo=TRUE) - retrieve setting $setting (if $setting exists)
        - get_settings($tab, $echo=FALSE) - retrieve all settings within tab $tab (if $tab exists)
        - set_setting($setting, $value) - set a setting's value (if $setting exists)
        - return_setting - shorthand for get_setting($setting, $echo=FALSE)
        - NEED TO ADD TAB FOR THIS => add_setting($setting) - add a new setting (if $setting does not exist)
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed array dereferencing issues. Plugin should now be compatible with PHP 5.2+
    - Fixed .htaccess for settings data. No longer accessible through browser/ HTTP requests (safer)
    - Fixed 'switch' input saving empty options array
    - Fixed moving a tab up or down causing settings' tab field to be changed
