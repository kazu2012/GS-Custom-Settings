[size=large]Description[/size]

GS Custom Settings is a plugin for <a href="http://get-simple.info/">GetSimple CMS </a>which lets webmasters/ site managers, theme and plugin developers implement and use their own custom settings for output, configuration, and cross-plugin/-theme communication. The plugin offers 8 different types of input to choose from, 3 access levels, per-user editing permission, and an easy UI to create, import and export the settings. GS Custom Settings is built on Knockout JS and uses JSON for data storage. 

This plugin was previously called KO Site Settings, but as the focus shifted away from the original intent, 
I renamed it custom settings, as these are now available for website, theme, and plugins.

[size=large]Download & install[/size]

You can download this plugin [url=http://get-simple.info/extend/plugin/ko-site-settings/913/]in the Extend repository[/url]. 
To install, simply extract the ZIP file to the plugins directory, and activate it in the Plugins tab. A new tab 'Site' will appear in which you can use the plugin. If you had previously installed v0.1 (KO Site Settings), first [b]deactivate it[/b], then extract and activate v0.2. 

[size=large]Basic usage[/size]

After you activate the plugin in the 'Plugins' tab, a custom 'Site' tab will show up. 
Here, go to 'Edit' mode to start building your settings :)
To get a setting in a page (in the WYSIWYG editor), simply type [u](% setting: tab/setting %)[/u].
To output a setting in PHP, type [u]<?php get_setting('tab','setting') ?>[/u].
To return a setting in PHP, type [u]<?php return_setting('tab', 'setting') ?>[/u].
